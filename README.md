# Welcome to my github repository where I showcase and share my projects.

## About Me:
Hi, my name is Barati. I am a business analytics student at Macquarie University with skills in Python, SQL, Excel and Tableau. I am interested in data science, business analytics and business intelligence opportunities in the near future. If you would like to learn more about me, you can view my resume which has more details on how to connect with me.

Below is a description of the projects in this portfolio.

## Python
LumiaLights is a fictional company that I studied to understand the lights and lighting industry.  I used python to analyse key performance metrics related to sales, customer demographics and product inventory. These findings can assist. With strategic decision-making as it relates to operational efficiency, sales and support customer retention efforts.

The analysis revealed key trends in sales performance, including monthly variations and profitability by customer district, which can help refine marketing and resource allocation strategies. The customer retention analysis offered valuable insights into engagement patterns, while examining item types and average order values shed light on customer preferences and spending habits. Statistical tests identified significant differences in sales and profitability across different order types and currency segments, guiding LuminaTech in optimizing resource distribution. Inference analysis highlighted the effects of factors like cost and quantity on sales, while predictive modeling provided a solid framework for forecasting future sales prices. Furthermore, customer churn analysis pinpointed the last activity gap, order frequency, and months of activity as critical indicators of churn, supporting targeted retention efforts.

## SQL
What trends and patterns can be observed in the data, and what do they indicate? How can ProApp, a shared economy startup learn from its data to adapt its business and address organisational issues such as managing new users, improving brand awareness  and devise strategies that would ensure that they remain competitive in this growing industry.

Using SQl, I was able to assist ProApp to answer questions such as:
* The service categories with the highest user rating
* The service categories with the lowest user rating
* The service categories that generate the most revenue
* The service categories in high demand and 
* The average rating for across users on the app.
	
The purpose of these SQL queries is to address the key areas of focus, including how the company can better manage taskers and users, minimise overhead when managing newly registered users, and resolve business issues.

## Excel
*Coffee Sales Dashboard* 
To analyse and visualise business data about coffee sales, I used Microsoft Excel to create an interactive dashboard. The goal of this dashboard is to show insights into various aspects of coffee sales, customer behaviour, and product performance. 

In Excel, XLOOKUP, Pivot tables and other formulas were used create a dashboard that sought to visualise sales over time, the sales per country and the top five customers based on raw data gathered about a coffee company's products, customers and orders.

This Excel dashboard consists of charts and slicers that offer a descriptive view of the dataset. Slicers are used as to tool to filter the data by various criteria such as date, roast type, size and whether the customer has a loyalty card. This provides a dynamic and interactive user experience, that provides greater detail and deeper insights.

## Tableau
The goal of this dashboard is to assist hospitals organise immediate triage and prioritise patients based on the severity of their condition. Hospitals can use this data to help monitor the availability of resources in real-time, allowing for efficient allocation and utilisation of resources. Healthcare professionals can make informed decisions in a time conscious way by accessing real-time data on patients. This can ensure efficient resource utilisation and improve overall ER operations.

Several visualisations were created to look at:
* Average wait time across the entire dataset
* Average wait time by month
* Average patient satisfaction score across entire dataset
* Average patient satisfaction score by month
* Number of patient visits by age per month
* Number of patient visits by race
* Number of patient referrals by department
* Average wait time by hour and day
